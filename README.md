## Design

## How the code works
![CODE](https://github.com/Neil-Patel-12/Soil_Moisture_Detector/assets/108227267/a9f597bd-b7cc-4fb3-a9ad-95f451010058) <br>
This flowchart describes an ongoing loop for the four lights installed on the soil moisture detector. It uses true and false statements to determine what level of water is in the soil, which would be distinguishable by the output of whatever light would come on based on the soil moisture. It’s designed like this for efficiency to see whenever the lights are out, the farmers, or gardeners will know to water the plants until they see all the lights come on the moisture detector. There is also a buzzer to indicate whenever the soil needs watering, so if the gardeners are busy doing something they will hear the ring go off and water immediately. <br>

## Identified a User Group
The user group we decided to target was for those who practice small-scale agriculture, and we hope to provide a solution that makes the process of gardening easier and more efficient. Along with that, when creating our prototype designs, we considered the variety of plants, the right temperature for these plants, the desired moisture of different plants, and how often a plant would need to be watered. For that reason, we developed product designs that would specifically address said factors. With this designs, we hope to make an impact on the gardening community. <br>

## Long Term Usage
- Our design team took ethical and environmental considerations seriously when creating the Soil Moisture Detector. We designed it to be inclusive, sustainable, and easy to use, ensuring that it meets the needs of our user group and others while having a very minimal impact on the environment. <br>
- When considering the product’s lifecycle, from development to disposal, we aimed to create a product that was not only practical but also environmentally and ethically responsive. <br>

## SolidWorks Design

- One challenge I had when designing this open/closing system was cutting everything in half and measuring everything halfway to make the soil moisture detector fit nice and snug. <br>
- The second challenge I had was thinking and designing the most effective closing/opening system. There are many ways I could have gone about designing this, but the holes and columns were the best choice because it allows for a smooth look rather and simple use. <br>
- One way I can improve the design would be to design a locking mechanism to ensure the parts don’t detach. <br>
